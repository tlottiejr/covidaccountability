        We do not collect or store your complaint text on this site. When you select a state,
        we link you to the official state medical board page. Any information you enter there
        is subject to that site’s privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Optional features on the Portal (save a local JSON copy, copy to clipboard) operate entirely in your browser.
        No data is sent to us. If we later enable an optional “reports” feature, we will clearly disclose what is stored,
        for how long, and for what purpose before you opt in.
