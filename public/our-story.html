      <p> IS YOUR STORY OUR STORY?</p>
      <p>OUR STORY</p>
      <p>COVIDAccountabilityNow is a community of individuals who feel the pain of significant and sustained illness and injury due to medical decisions that were made by physicians and medical professionals that ultimately were not in the best interest of the patient. Many people trusted their caregiver, as we all have been deeply trained to do. Ultimately many were misled, misinformed, misdirected, and injured by decision making that at best was experimental, reckless, negligent and sometimes even coercive or malicious. There were times of silence when concerns from injured and/or concerned parties were raised. These concerns were and are still being dismissed and many became threatened and coerced. Many physicians and medical authorities were quick to deny any potential harm, despite compelling evidence, including increasing reports to physicians of harm, and unambiguous reports from patient’s filled adverse event reports to VAERS and reports from their own clinical observations. There was a failure to uphold the most fundamental ethical principles of medicine and violations were widespread and ongoing. This led to unmitigated harm.</p>
      <p>Throughout this time while "practitioners" labeled themselves as the embattled opponents of a so called misinformation machine, they crossed wobbly ethical grounds while they eagerly directed millions of people, who trusted them, to take an EXPERIMENTAL gene based treatment. There are many examples of medical professionals participating in what can be described as a financial and political saga that encouraged vaccine usage in populations where risks were not properly disclosed and potential injuries, some ultimately fatal, were not recognized, acknowledged or were otherwise downplayed. On top of this, there was a political/medical/technology establishment that censored speech, punished dissenting voices in this debate, and discouraged open scientific discussion around risks, and any data that were not outwardly favorable or had the potential to harm the narrative, image and these products were too often dismissed and discredited without regard to safety for the people.</p>
      <p>Today, after these years of what can now be viewed as a period of widespread moral and medical failure, our site intends to be a turn in the tide. Our goal is to seek meaningful action in a way that is organized and sets the stage for change. Rather than create another space of endless debate, this site allows you to communicate your situation and initiate accountability through accepted mechanisms that should not be avoided or forgotten. These pathways exist and they need to be actively pursued.</p>
      <p>Our efforts here aim to organize and facilitate complaints against practitioners in a systematic and clear manner. This site empowers anyone that has suffered from acute injury and long-term health issues to file a complaint. This site provides the tools for you to document your experience, including evidence and witness statements, where appropriate, and submit a complaint to your state's medical board. The guidance provided here includes precisely what information will be helpful when filing your complaint.</p>
      <p>It must be acknowledged that due to unusual policies and rapid changes in the reporting structure of the medical community, we will be working in a space that will require persistence and faith. We hope to encourage as many of you as possible to file these complaints.</p>
      <p>It is not the goal of this site to debate every single medical decision. We are hopeful that this platform can be used by those who had injuries and to invite providers to remember their oath and to be engaged constructively in seeking accountability. We also hope that eventually this will allow an increase of awareness in our medical system of who are the practitioners that have made decisions that resulted in harm to patients and to help us all remember that we must prioritize the wellbeing of the patient first, above politics, profit, and convenience.</p>
      <p>Note: While many people were injured through the coercion and/or direction to receive the gene based “vaccine” there are also those who have suffered harm because of the decision by their provider to refuse life saving treatment (for instance, ventilators were not always the correct course), the provider refused treatment and the person suffered and was injured or died. There were cases where early treatment was refused, and people developed unnecessarily severe disease and had resolution with later and less preferred therapies. There were injuries from the COVID “shield” which means patient did not receive care for a period of time. This also hindered education and career opportunities and a variety of other situations which we must acknowledge were the result of choices made by health care providers or regulators.</p>
      <p>For those who feel they are injured or have suffered due to these tragic medical decisions we want you to know that we are here to support you in the process of filing a complaint with your state’s medical board. We want to empower you to ensure that your experience is documented and that your voice is heard by those who are responsible for oversight and accountability in the medical profession. Your experience matters and it deserves to be recognized and addressed through the proper channels.</p>
      <p>To be clear, this is not a movement to malign or snipe at any and all doctors which is not correct and rather unproductive. Instead, this aims to call out the future use of anything experimental and temporary without proper countervailing oversights. We hope that this will be a push for a return to proper ethical behavior in a corrective manner with confident, compassionate skilled people, and parties who are engaged in seeing that this never happens again.</p>
      <p>We want to be honest about the reality that Social Media influencers, entrenched politicians, recalcitrant bureaucrats that have mastered the art of saying everything and nothing, are not the people that can create accountability. The value of clinical knowledge, true experience on the ground, and wisdom that truly protects the future generation needs to be prized. This is a call to be real and true and this can only happen when the truth and patient are put first.</p>
      <p>We encourage anyone who has experienced harm by receiving the COVID modRNA “vaccine” or by refusing experimental medications or was otherwise injured by choices made by practitioners to file a professional complaint. This opportunity is not inefficacious; meaningful accountability is every person’s burden. The mechanism exists to file a complaint, and we assert this right should be pursued in all cases. The filing of complaints are to be pursued through a professional complaint. The ethical duty of medical licensing agencies is to fully investigate and take responsive action in cases where the standard of care was not met, or entitled patients were not informed of the risk of injurious consequences. We believe any violations of legal and ethical duty, including informed consent, should be pursued with a professional complaint.</p>
      <p>Further, while there might have been censorship online, any claim of medical censorship that allowed information to be distributed that could potentially affect the health and living of others, in ways that were injurious or had negative implications shouldn’t be ignored. Healthy discussion between professionals across the spectrum and with the public should never have been curtailed. These types of discussions are needed for the future of medicine and technological science to prosper and we would not want our children to have similar experiences. We are not advocating the replacement of one moral corruption with another. At the minimum our goal is to promote practices and norms that would prevent a repeat of these hurried, non-transparent regulatory and medical political decisions in the future that led to widespread loss and long-term injury.</p>
      <p>In summary, a medical exemption framework already exists. We need to use it to build a case against people who did not pursue policies and behaviors that the law and proper medical ethics demand or at least encourage. The state medical boards along with state statutes provide methods to file a complaint, and since no experimental drug can be required, The United States has a carve out around emergency use authorization: emergency use authorization means that the healthcare providing entity must allow exemptions for medical and religious reasons. This means in all cases doctor’s and healthcare facilities and employers that required mandated COVID vaccination were in violation of law.1 Only a temporal relation is required and not causation.</p>
