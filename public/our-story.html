    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <section class="card">
      <p>COVIDAccountabilityNow is a community of individuals who feel the pain of significant and
sustained illness following the COVID modRNA injection. Many of us, when seeking help for our
symptoms from physicians who promoted the injection, were told there is no relation
between the two ("correlation is not causation"). Consequently, our community have
generally lacked adequate care from these physicians and many have been deferred to seek
care elsewhere. Moreover, some have simply been dismissed as emotional or histrionic. To add
insult to injury, many of these physicians have refused to report the adverse events to VAERS
when specifically requested, even though reporting is required by law.<sup><a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a></sup> Only a temporal relationship
is required and not causation.</p>
      <p>Many have been calling for accountability regarding COVID modRNA harms and associated
unprofessional behavior. In fact, there have been many public hearings regarding the issue and
even some calling for Nuremberg 2.<sup><a href="https://rumble.com/v6w6cqw-psi-hearing-voices-of-the-vaccine-injured.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a></sup> However, one cannot solve a problem without
understanding the cause. Very few people in the world understand the lynchpin supporting the
“needle in every arm” COVID campaign. One person who explains this all too well is human
rights activist Vera Sherav.<sup><a href="https://ahrp.org/vera-sharav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="https://rumble.com/v6s6ddn-how-healers-become-killers-vera-sharav.html?e9s=src_v1_s%2Csrc_v1_s_o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4</a></sup> That is because she is one of a diminishing number of Holocaust
survivors living today. Through her provocative video, she reveals that the lynchpin in this
narrative is physician complicity. It doesn’t matter how many senior public health officials
promoted the injection, the majority of the populace would not have participated in the
experiment without direction from their community physician.</p>
      <p>But what can be done about this physician complicity? Many have highlighted the ethical
violations involved. However, few persons grasp the widespread
medical incompetence that has transpired during the COVID narrative. This is the first time in
modern medical history that a decision was made to deploy an experimental injection rapidly
across essentially the entire population, based on a single limited (two month) data set. Based
on a basic benefit-risk assessment of that readily available data, peer reviewed published
literature indicates that any physician administering or advising the treatment failed two core
competencies required for licensure and safe medical practice in the community. Many believe
this unprofessional behavior is protected by emergency use authorization without considering
other strategies. Our community appreciates an alternative regulatory pathway to advance
accountability so as to prevent doctors from contributing to another "mass iatrogenic" event.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373989367_COVID-19_vaccine-associated_mortality_in_the_Southern_Hemisphere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5</a></sup></p>
