        Many have been calling for accountability regarding COVID modRNA harms. In fact, there have been
        many public hearings regarding the issue and even some calling for Nuremberg 2.<sup>1</sup>
        However, one cannot solve a problem without understanding the cause. Very few people in the world
        understand the lynchpin supporting the “needle in every arm” COVID campaign. One person who explains
        this all too well is human rights activist Vera Sharav.<sup>2,3</sup> That is because she is one of a
        diminishing number of Holocaust survivors living today. Through her provocative video, she reveals
        that the lynchpin in this narrative is physician complicity. It doesn’t really matter how many senior
        public health officials promoted the injection, the majority of the populace would not have participated
        in the experiment without direction from their community physician.
      </p>

        But what can be done about this physician complicity? Many have highlighted the ethical violations involved.
        However, few laypersons grasp the previously unfathomable widespread medical incompetence that has transpired
        during the COVID narrative. This is the first time in modern medical history that a decision was made to deploy
        an experimental injection rapidly across essentially the entire population based on a single limited (two month)
        data set. Based on a basic benefit-risk assessment of that readily available data, peer-reviewed published
        literature indicates that any physician administering or advising the treatment failed two core competencies
        required for licensure and safe medical practice in the community. Many believe this unprofessional behavior is
        protected by emergency use authorization without considering other strategies. Our community appreciates an
        alternative regulatory pathway to advance accountability and effect change.
