<section class="card"><h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Many have been calling for accountability regarding COVID modRNA harms. There have been public hearings and calls for accountability. Our view is that physician complicity formed a central part of the campaign — most people would not have participated in the experiment without direction from their community physician.</p>
<p>But what can be done about this physician complicity? Many have looked to the courts and other avenues. This project focuses on an alternative regulatory pathway to advance accountability and effect change.</p>
