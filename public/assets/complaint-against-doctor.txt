Complaint Against Doctor 
Regarding advising the COVID-19 vaccine causing personal harm.

I was injected with the COVID-19 modRNA treatment under the direction of [PHYSICIAN NAME, CREDENTIALS, SPECIALTY] on [DATE] and subsequently experienced [DESCRIPTION OF INJURY / ADVERSE EFFECTS] which I believe were caused by the medical decision making and advisement of the physician and/or medical provider indicated on this complaint, resulting in the harm described.
Prior to the usage of the COVID spike coded gene based treatment, there was evidence available to medical practitioners in the United States indicating the COVID gene treatment lacked evidence of effectiveness and lacked sufficient evidence to conclude safety. There were sufficient red flags in the trial documentation, and other publicly available data, to conclude that any potential benefits did not outweigh the risk for the patient population and that certain subgroups were at even higher risk. Practitioners had a responsibility to review the evidence and to ensure informed consent was properly obtained.
