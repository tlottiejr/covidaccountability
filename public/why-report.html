    <h2>Why Report & Why Now</h2>
    <p>Your report could prevent another person from sustaining a serious adverse event, including death. After years of litigation and investigation, accountability and restitution have been limited. Filing a complaint provides another pathway toward accountability, and the statute of limitations is often longer (or nonexistent) in some states.</p>
    <p>The vaccination campaign began in December 2020 and continued while reports of serious adverse events accumulated. Many analyses, reports and debates have followed. Your report now can help advance accountability.</p>
