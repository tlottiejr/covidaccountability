        Your report could prevent another person from sustaining a serious adverse event including death.
        Four years after many millions of dollars of civil litigation and a 2 year congressional investigation,
        no appreciable accountability or restitution for injured patients has occurred as medical liability has
        been shielded by the PREP Act.<sup>1</sup> Filing a complaint allows an additional pathway toward
        accountability as the statute of limitations is generally longer or nonexistent in some states.

        Deployment of the COVID experimental modRNA treatment began in December 2020 under the direction of the Health and
        Human Services department despite the BNT162b2 trial data published December 10th showing more risk than benefit
        for the trial participants. The campaign continued despite VAERS data documenting record serious adverse events
        including death within several weeks of launching the campaign. Still the injection was promoted by physicians
        despite the Pfizer Post-Authorization Adverse Event Report through February 28th (presented to the FDA)
        showing 1223 fatalities.<sup>2</sup> By the end of the year 2021, 22,233 deaths had been reported to VAERS.<sup>3</sup>
        One public health expert analysis has indicated 17.0 ± 0.5 million COVID-19 vaccine deaths worldwide up to
        2 September 2023.<sup>4</sup> More than four years later the injection continues to be recommended by physicians
        and injuries continue to accumulate. Your report now could help advance accountability.
