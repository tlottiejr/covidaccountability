    <h1>Why Report &amp; Why Now</h1>
<section class="card">
<p>Your report could prevent another person from sustaining a serious adverse event including
death. Four years after millions of dollars of civil litigation and a 2 year congressional
investigation, no appreciable accountability or restitution for injured parties has occurred. 
Medical liability has been shielded by the PREP Act.<sup><a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/final-report-covid-select-concludes-2-year-investigation-issues-500-page-final-report-on-lessons-learned-and-the-path-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a></sup> Filing a complaint allows an additional
pathway toward accountability as the statute of limitations is generally longer or nonexistent in
some states.</p>
<p>Deployment of the experimental modRNA began in December 2020 under the
direction of the Health and Human Services department. This is despite the BNT162b2 trial data
(published December 10<sup>th</sup>) showing more risk than benefit for the trial participants. The
campaign continued despite VAERS data documenting record serious adverse events, including 
deaths within several weeks of launch. Still the injection was promoted by
physicians despite the Pfizer Post-Authorization Adverse Event Report through February 28<sup>th</sup>
(presented to the FDA) showing 1,223 fatalities.<sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/cumulative-analysis-of-post-authorization-adverse-event-reports-of-pf-07302048-bnt162b2/page/6/mode/2up" rel="noopener">2</a></sup> By year end 2021, more than 22 thousand deaths 
were reported to VAERS.<sup><a href="https://openvaers.com/covid-data/mortality" rel="noopener">3</a></sup> One public health expert analysis indicated "17.0 ± 0.5 million
COVID-19 vaccine deaths worldwide" up to September 2, 2023.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373989367_COVID-19_vaccine-associated_mortality_in_the_Southern_Hemisphere" rel="noopener">4</a></sup> More than four years later the
injection continues to be recommended by physicians and injuries continue to accumulate.
Your report now could help protect another person from injury and advance accountability.</p>
