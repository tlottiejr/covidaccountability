      <p>
        <strong>Any funds received will be used to support the infrastructure of the site, and support injured parties involved in filing a complaint.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We operate at the highest level of integrity. Donations are used to maintain and improve the infrastructure that makes this mission possible
        (hosting, bandwidth, security, accessibility, and ongoing development).
      </p>
      <p>
        We intend to tithe a portion of proceeds and, as resources allow, provide direct support to injured parties preparing and filing complaints.
        As donations scale (e.g., five figures), we also plan to make a dedicated contribution to the REACT19 founder with a message of contact.
      </p>

        Thank you for helping us keep this effort sustainable and independent.
