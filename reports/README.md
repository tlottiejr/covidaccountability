# Link-health & Uptime Reports

This folder stores machine-readable artifacts generated by GitHub Actions.

- `references-links-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.json` – raw Lychee JSON from the daily References link check.
- `LATEST.references.json` – summarized counts used by the site badge.
- Other jobs may drop additional artifacts here following a similar naming convention.

Workflows are **warn-only**; they should not block deploys. See `.github/workflows/link-health-references.yml`.
